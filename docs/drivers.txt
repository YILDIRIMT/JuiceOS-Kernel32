There is information about drivers written for this OS.

SCREEN.HPP / SCREEN.CPP --- Screen driver ---------------------------------------------------

PS2.HPP / PS2.CPP --- PS/2 keyboard driver --------------------------------------------------
This is a PS/2 keyboard driver. It has functions for waiting for scancode and
waiting for any key with returning its ASCII value. It can handle Shift, CapsLock and Ctrl.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PCI.HPP / PCI.CPP --- PCI driver ------------------------------------------------------------
This driver provides functions to find PCI devices and communicate with them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDE.H / IDE.CPP --- IDE controller driver ---------------------------------------------------
Handles ATA devices. Contains a registry of them which is used like the only registry of
storage devices for now (the abstraction should be done eventually). At initialization tries
to check all connected non-packet devices and register them. Only allows to read data from
devices for now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AHCI.HPP / AHCI.CPP - AHCI driver (moved to 'non_ready') ------------------------------------
